# Empirical Study on Unified Foundational Ontology Kinds
Replication package &amp; final results for the empirical study on UFO

This repository consolidates the findings, as well as the replication and supplementary materials, from our studies on the Empirical Study on Unified Foundational Ontology: Kinds. 

Kinds and basic classes both aim to define the most fundamen-
tal classifications done by human beings. Kind is a concept from
the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) that focuses on “what”
something is from a semantic standpoint, while basic classes are
concerned with how something feels from a cognitive standpoint.
However, there are key distinctions that lead to a gap between both
concepts. By looking at their divergences in definition, it becomes
apparent why finding a correspondence between the two is impor-
tant. There are many cases where cognitively basic classifications
such as "student" or "mother," are not considered Kinds and where
some Kinds like "mammal" and "organization" may not be easy to in-
terpret. The more aligned these cognitive and semantic definitions
are, the transfer and representation of knowledge in conceptual
modeling also becomes more efficient. This leads to the need to
find out if there is a significant convergence between basic cate-
gories and Kinds to the point where, from a cognitive standpoint,
the description of a Kind is in most cases aligned with basic-classes.
The UFO is a framework for conceptual modeling, under one of
its branches, it formalizes the way humans conceptualize, categorize,
and order different abstractions of reality under a specific domain.
However, this ontology is still a set of guidelines and cannot force
different people to have the same reasoning through the modeling
process. There is a lack of empirical evidence regarding whether
UFO achieves a common reasoning standard for classifications. By
testing if all modelers agree on Kinds for different domains, and
if there is alignment with the semantic and cognitive definitions
presented, the study explores whether UFO does indeed lead the
reasoning of its users towards the same classifications. By bridging
cognition and semantics through empirical evidence, the research
aims to provide a stronger foundation to the Unified Foundational
Ontology as a whole.

The following research questions are introduced to guide the
empirical study:
RQ1: To what extent do modelers agree on what are the Kinds in a
domain?
RQ2: To what extent do people agree on the basic-level categories
they use to classify objects?
RQ3: Is there a relationship between basic-level categories used to
classify objects and the classes stereotyped as «kind» by con-
ceptual modelers?

Two surveys have been conducted to cover the three research
questions. The first survey is designed to approach an answer for
RQ1, asking experts to select Kinds in taxonomies for multiple
domains to measure the proportion of Kind-level classifications
and their answer agreement. Survey 2 is for RQ2, providing an
image-naming task to the general population showing them random
elements from the same domains of Survey 1. The two surveys are
aligned through the elements of the domains so that crossing the
data can help answer RQ3.

NOTE: PYTHON SCRIPTS ARE USED ALONGSIDE THE PROCESSED DATA RESULTS. For nonexperts, python dictionary for "most popular" term in the code is done externally. I personally used filters in excel to do total counts per word, and then account for spelling mistakes and capitalization.
